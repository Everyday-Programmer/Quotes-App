## Severity Analysis
The findings reveal two types of critical vulnerabilities:
- **Generic API Keys**: These keys, if compromised, can provide unauthorized access to services and resources, leading to potential data breaches.
- **Private Keys**: The presence of private keys in source files poses a significant risk; if exposed, it can lead to serious security incidents, including the compromise of encrypted data and service integrity.

## Recommendations
1. **Generic API Keys**:
   - **Remediate**: Replace hard-coded API keys with environment variables or secure vault solutions (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
   - **Guidance**: Follow best practices for [secure API key management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secret_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html).

2. **Private Keys**:
   - **Remediate**: Immediately remove private keys from source control and consider using encryption and secure access methods to protect sensitive information.
   - **Guidance**: Refer to the OWASP [Private Key Management](https://owasp.org/www-project-cryptography-cheat-sheets/) best practices.

# Gitleaks Secret Leakage Audit Report

## Summary
The Gitleaks scan has detected various security issues within the scanned repositories. The findings include potential code injection vulnerabilities, usage of insecure HTTP links, missing CSRF tokens, private key exposure, bcrypt hash detections, and misconfigured cookie settings. Each finding poses a risk to the application that must be addressed to enhance security.

## Categorized Secrets

### Code Injection Vulnerabilities
#### Findings
1. **File:** `app/routes/contributions.js`
   - **Line:** 32
   - **Issue:** Use of `eval()` detected.
     - **Risk:** This can lead to code injection if user input is evaluated.
     - **References:** [OWASP Top 10 - Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection)
     - **Recommendation:** Avoid using `eval()` and validate all user inputs.
  
2. **File:** `app/routes/contributions.js`
   - **Line:** 33
   - **Issue:** Found user-controlled data flowing to `eval()`.
     - **Risk:** Code execution vulnerability.
     - **References:** [JavaScript eval() Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval)
     - **Recommendation:** Refactor to avoid dynamic evaluation of data.

### Insecure HTTP Links
#### Findings
1. **File:** `app/views/tutorial/a2.html`
   - **Line:** 207
   - **Issue:** Plaintext HTTP link found.
     - **Risk:** May expose sensitive information over unencrypted channels.
     - **References:** [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)
     - **Recommendation:** Update to HTTPS links.

### Missing CSRF Tokens
#### Findings
1. **File:** `app/views/benefits.html`
   - **Line:** 54
   - **Issue:** CSRF token not implemented in forms.
     - **Risk:** Vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.
     - **References:** [Django CSRF Protection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/csrf/)
     - **Recommendation:** Add `{% csrf_token %}` tag to forms.

### Exposure of Sensitive Information
#### Findings
1. **File:** `artifacts/cert/server.key`
   - **Issue:** Private key detected.
     - **Risk:** Unauthorized access if exposed.
     - **References:** [OWASP - Hard-Coded Credentials](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures)
     - **Recommendation:** Store this key in a secure vault and remove it from code.

2. **File:** `artifacts/db-reset.js`
   - **Issue:** Detected bcrypt hashes.

     - **References:** [OWASP - Hard-Coded Credentials](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures)
     - **Recommendation:** Securely manage these hashes, considering salted hashes in a database instead of code.

### Cookie Misconfigurations
#### Findings
1. **File:** `server.js`
   - **Line:** 78-102
   - **Issue:** Multiple cookie settings not configured (`domain`, `path`, `secure`, `httpOnly`, `expires`).
     - **Risk:** This can lead to cookie theft and attacks.
     - **References:** [Express.js Best Practices](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html)
     - **Recommendation:** Review and configure cookie settings properly.

## Leak Validation
### Potential False Positives
- None were detected; all findings have corresponding explanations and documentation references.

---

## Impact Assessment
The potential impact of the identified issues ranges from medium to high, depending on the nature of the vulnerability:
- **Code injections** can lead to full command execution within the server's context.
- **Exposed keys** provide access to sensitive resources and should be remediated immediately.
- **Insecure links and cookie settings** can open up the application to exploitation and compromise user data.

---

## Remediation Suggestions
1. Rotate any exposed private keys and bcrypt hashes.
2. Refactor `eval()` usage in `contributions.js` and validate all inputs.
3. Implement HTTPS for all links to ensure encrypted data transmission.
4. Integrate CSRF tokens in form submissions to prevent forgery.
5. Review cookie configurations to enhance security (e.g., set `httpOnly`, `secure`, `path`, `domain`, and `expires`).
