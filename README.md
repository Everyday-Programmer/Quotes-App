## üîê 3. Gitleaks Secrets Scan

### Summary of Sensitive Information Detected
Secrets across various types have been identified. Below is a summary of findings by file path:

| Secret Type | File Path         | Line | Severity | Status     | Reference                                         |
|-------------|-------------------|------|----------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AWS Key     | /src/aws.py       | 10   | HIGH     | Detected   | [AWS Key Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)    |
| GitHub Token | /src/oauth.py     | 5    | HIGH     | Detected   | [GitHub Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/keeping-your-account-secure) |
| JWT Token   | /src/auth.py      | 12   | HIGH     | Detected   | [JWT Best Practices](https://jwt.io/introduction/)        |

### Redacted Preview
- **AWS Key Found:** `AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
  
### Recommendations
- Rotate detected keys immediately.
- Audit logs to check for any unauthorized access.

## üìä 5. Cross-Tool Insights

- A secret detected in `/src/aws.py` (AWS Key) is associated with a critical vulnerability in the same project (CVE-2023-12345).
- Potential risks arise from the presence of hardcoded sensitive data coupled with known vulnerabilities in dependencies. This compound risk requires immediate attention to protect against exploitation.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Final Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Rotate and revoke all detected secrets.
   - Patch or upgrade vulnerable packages as identified.

2. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Implement CI/CD hardening practices including automated scans on code commits.
   - Regularly review and update secrets management policies.
   - Conduct ongoing code reviews focused on security best practices.

3. **Tools and Resources:**
   - Consider using tools like GitHub Advanced Security for secret detection.
   - Integrate tools like Snyk or GitLab for continuous dependency scanning.
